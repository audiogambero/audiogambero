👋 Hey everyone, I’m @audiogambero 🔊🦐
I'm a developer for Acustica Audio. In my spare time I work on personal projects that, as my username suggest, are audio-related.
I'm currently working on a SID controller library for Teensy, and on various audio plug-ins.
Currently studying SW protection.
If you want to contact me, this is my email: samuele.gamberoni.audio@gmail.com.
